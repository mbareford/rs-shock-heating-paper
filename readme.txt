This repository contains the tex file for the paper entitled "Shock Heating in Numerical Simulations of Kink-unstable Coronal Loops"
submitted to Proceedings A of the Royal Society in 2015. It also contains the instructions, scripts and some of the data required to
reproduce the figures presented in the paper, see ./scripts/readme.txt.

The simulation data not included in this repository are the lare3d CFD files, since each CFD file is several GBs in size.
The CFD files can be created by re-running the simulation by compiling an executable from the source code, see ./codes/lare3d/readme.txt.
