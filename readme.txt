This repository contains the supporting files for the paper entitled "Shock Heating in Numerical Simulations of Kink-unstable Coronal Loops"
submitted to Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, see http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/2042/20140266. Specifically, this repository contains the instructions,
scripts and some of the data required to reproduce the figures presented in the paper, see ./scripts/readme.txt.

The simulation data not included in this repository are the lare3d CFD files, since each CFD file is several GBs in size.
The CFD files can be created by re-running the simulation by compiling an executable from the source code, see ./codes/lare3d/readme.txt.
